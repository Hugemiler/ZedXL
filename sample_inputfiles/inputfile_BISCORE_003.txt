		# 'bis' for a point-biserial correlation agains total number of constraints
		# 'rscore' for the so-called "RestrictionScore", weighted frequency, implemented on this package
		# 'biscore' for the so-called 'biscore' versus similarity to highest "davies consensus" score model
		# 'biscore_native' for the so-called 'biscore' versus similarity to native structure (requires lovoalign.log against native)

		# 'biscore_regression' for the so-called 'biscore' versus similarity to highest "regression consensus" (implemented on this package) score model
