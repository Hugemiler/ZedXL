Description: 
    This package is oriented towards analyzing a group of protein tertiary structures files generated through different modeling/simulation strategies.
    Its main protocol takes as input a collection of logs generated by software created and mantained by our research group (MÂ³G) based in the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). In order to utilize the package adequately, PDB files have to be preprocessed by a combination of sotwares, namely TOPOLINK, LOVOALIGN and GSCORE. Links to those softwares are provided below.
    In order to increase effectiveness and solve major usage problems, simple tutorials have been provided and can be acessed via --UNDER CONSTRUCTION--
